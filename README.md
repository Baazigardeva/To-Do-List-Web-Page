# To-Do-List-Web-Page
The project is a single web page containing text area to add custom tasks. The “Add” button lets the user add an object to the list. We have the facility to check the items from the list or remove them if we want. If we wish, we can clear all the list items with a single button. It is one of the most common projects for developers.
